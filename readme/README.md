***DRAFT/WORKING COPY AS OF 05OCT2021***

This is my first professionally developed website, from design to implementation and to fully operational. 

I took this on as a challenge to my current front-end skills and as a favor for a local business/friend of a friend. 

As of now my front end skills are limited to HTML and CSS. 

I started teaching myself these skills in June of this year. As of now, the only other things in my GitHub Repository are some Front End Mentor challenges I have used to develop myself.

        /*I am taking it live at this point to see how the mobile design is responding*/



*Client Encounters*

I made it very clear to the client/owner that I had never made a professional website and that I was still in the early learning phases of website development and design.

As of me beginning this project the only online presence WSP has is a semi-regularly maintained Facebook page:

                - https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=wandering%20spirit%20photography


The very first step was to determine the timeline she wanted this completed in. She said she needed it to be completed within the next month (NLT NOV 2021). I was happy with this timeframe. Up to this point I had been able to complete the FEM chalenges overnight in around a 2-8 hour timeframe, depending on the challenge and complexity of the project.

I told her from the start this would be free of charge, minus whatever start-up or domain name fees there may be to actually take the website live.

During our first few conversations she told me about her share drive full of photos and I requested full access so I could gage the skill and style of work she performs. I wanted to see what kind of website I could design with the product the client was putting out.

                - I loved her logo. She has a larger, more wordy logo, that I was able to clip the 'WS' logo from for smaller spaces.
                

As of our last conversations, she has explained that she loves clean adn professional designs and wants her website as such. Her focus as a photographer is to be professional and welcoming to incoming clients.



*Design Process*

My first steps into developing a design for this website was to talk to the client and gauge their online presence.

I then looked at several websites in the same industry in the same city to gauge what others were presenting and what my clients website would be going up against.

                - My first impressions were that local websites were clunky and less professional than what I had in mind. I found some pieces I liked that I wanted to include in this website, but I felt good in my ability to design a website going up against the local competition.
                
  
Lastly I looked at some professional photography websites to see what top performing professionals were using. These became the largest pieces of inspiration for my simple, monochromatic design.

I used Figma to create two different designs with the same core concepts and sent them to her for some final approval and design notes.

Once a desktop design was chosen I developed a quick mobile design for the home page to base my responsive CSS off of.



*Development*

I started with the 'Home' page to ensure I had the responsive measures in place for a smooth transition between desktop and mobile screens.

I am having a lot of trouble with the responsive nav bar as well as the Logo img responsiveness, sizing, and placement.

                - I am afraid I will need to scrap almost 6.5 hours of work to simplify my HTML and CSS, but I believe it would be worth it to have a cleaner/better functioning final product.
                
                
                - I was correct. Although the initial load up onto a mobile device looks exactly as intended, it is not responsive. The heeader does not grow or shrink and the images leave white space at the bottom with the ability to scroll. I will have to revisit height/width and overall resppnsiveness.


After completely starting over I was able to clean up the HTML and CSS. My web page is responsive and fits into vh like I intended it to. CHecking for mobile devices now.
